    "# Open-Source vs. Closed-Source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The video provides an overview of the best closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs), contrasting them with open-source models. Closed-source LLMs require payment for API access and often for full feature access on their standard interfaces, unlike free and downloadable open-source models that can be run locally and fine-tuned. The main closed-source players discussed are OpenAI (ChatGPT), Google (Gemini), and Anthropic (Claude). While Microsoft (Copilot) integrates OpenAI models, they also have an open-source model (Pi three). Meta exclusively focuses on open-source LLMs. The video aims to guide users on when to use specific closed-source LLMs and their interfaces like Poe and Perplexity.\n",

    "# Claude by Anthropic: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The video introduces Claude, an LLM from Anthropic, positioning it as the third-best closed-source model after ChatGPT and Google Gemini, according to the speaker and the Chatbot Arena rankings. While Claude offers a free tier with the Claude 3 Sonnet model, the more powerful Claude 3 Opus requires a paid subscription. The speaker finds the free version \"okay\" but not exceptional, generally preferring other models except for Claude's unique ability to automatically convert pasted text into a file for analysis. Claude supports file and image uploads, making it multimodal, but its output quality is currently not considered the best. The video briefly mentions Claude's API, which will be discussed later, and notes that while Anthropic's benchmarks present Claude 3 Opus favorably against older models, it is currently considered inferior to GPT-4 Omni. The speaker concludes that while Claude is a significant player in the LLM landscape and worth trying, it currently lacks the features and performance of ChatGPT and Gemini for most use cases, though it might improve in future iterations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This video explains the Microsoft Copilot, clarifying that it's essentially ChatGPT integrated into Microsoft products. Microsoft's significant investment in OpenAI allows them to use OpenAI's language models within applications like Word, Excel, and Bing. When a user inputs a prompt into a Copilot interface, the prompt undergoes a process called \"grounding\" to determine if external resources like web searches are needed. The prompt is then tokenized and sent via API call to OpenAI's LLM (ChatGPT), which generates a response. This response is processed for compliance and then delivered back to the user within their Microsoft application. Importantly, the video emphasizes that user data, prompts, and responses within the Copilot are not used to train OpenAI's models, ensuring data privacy.\n",

    "# Conclusion on Microsoft Copilot\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The video reflects on the overall usefulness of Microsoft Copilot, acknowledging its potential benefits for users heavily invested in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. However, it raises concerns about the cost-effectiveness of the subscription, particularly for those who don't frequently use Microsoft's applications. The speaker briefly mentions Copilot Studios, a business-oriented tool for creating custom AI agents, but expresses skepticism about its value proposition compared to alternative development tools like Vector Shift, Flow Wise, and Lang Chain, which will be covered later in the course.\n",

    "# Review of the Closed-Source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This section recaps the exploration of closed-source Large Language Models (LLMs). It revisits the factors beyond token limit and model size that influence LLM performance, emphasizing the importance of training data, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. The Chatbot Arena is highlighted as a tool for tracking current LLM rankings. The summary then touches on key takeaways from the discussion of each model and platform: Google Gemini (noting its strengths and weaknesses), Anthropic's Claude (the speaker's lack of personal use), Perplexity (as an enhanced search tool), and Microsoft Copilot (its integration with Microsoft 365 and associated costs). The speaker reiterates the importance of cost-benefit analysis for subscriptions and encourages sharing the course.\n",
