    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment clarifies that using powerful AI models doesn't require subscriptions but can be done via APIs like OpenAI's, where payment is based on token usage, and provides a detailed walkthrough of the OpenAI API documentation covering models, features, getting started, and moderation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💸 You can access the best models via API without a subscription, paying only per token generated.\n",
    "- 🐍 The API can be integrated into environments like Google Colab or custom apps, commonly using Python, Curl, or Node.js.\n",
    "- 📄 The OpenAI API documentation details various models available, including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-3.5.\n",
    "- ✨ The API offers diverse capabilities like text generation, embeddings, image generation (DALL-E), text-to-speech, speech-to-text (Whisper), fine-tuning, vision, and the Assistants API with function calling and code interpreter.\n",
    "- ⚙️ Key sections in the documentation include introduction, key concepts, quickstart guide (account setup, API key creation), tutorials, and moderation policies.\n",
    "- 🛠️ The documentation includes resources like a help center, developer forum, and service status.\n",

    "# Pricing Models of the OpenAI API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This section details the pricing of the OpenAI API, explaining the pay-per-token model for various models and capabilities, demonstrating its relative affordability compared to subscriptions, and outlining the costs for different services like text generation, embeddings, image generation, audio models, and the Assistant API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 💲 OpenAI API pricing is based on tokens (input and output), with options to view costs per 1,000 or 1 million tokens.\n",
    "- 📈 Pricing varies by model, with newer models like GPT-4o having different input and output token costs ($5 and $15 per 1 million tokens, respectively), while GPT-3.5 Turbo is significantly cheaper ($0.50 and $1.50 per 1 million tokens).\n",
    "- 📏 1 million tokens are approximately equivalent to 750,000 words, illustrating that even small amounts of text processing are very inexpensive.\n",
    "- 🖼️ Costs for other API capabilities are also outlined, including embedding models (cheap), fine-tuning (training, input, output costs), Assistant API features (Code Interpreter session cost, file storage), and image generation with DALL-E (varying prices based on resolution and model).\n",
    "- 🎧 Audio models like Whisper (transcription) are presented as very cheap, while Text-to-Speech has a higher cost per character.\n",
    "- ✅ Overall API usage is described as generally cheap, especially for experimentation or simpler applications, potentially saving money compared to a ChatGPT subscription.\n",
    "- ▶️ The next video will demonstrate the OpenAI Playground, a fixed interface for experimenting with the API, where users only pay for tokens generated.\n",

    "\n",
    "This video provides an overview of the Google Gemini API, accessible through Google Cloud's Vertex AI, discussing its documentation, supported languages and environments, available models, pricing structure compared to OpenAI, and demonstrating its multimodal capabilities in a playground-like interface, although the speaker expresses a preference for OpenAI's models for core development tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🚀 Introduces the Google Gemini API as Google's alternative to OpenAI, with documentation and SDKs available for multiple languages (Python, Android, Node.js, Swift, etc.) and development environments (Google Colab, VS Code).\n",
    "- 💻 Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform is the primary interface for accessing and experimenting with Gemini models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini Flash.\n",
    "- 💰 Discusses Gemini's pricing, which is token-based and frequently updated, noting it can be competitive or even cheaper than OpenAI for shorter prompts but potentially more expensive for longer ones.\n",
    "- 🧪 Vertex AI offers a playground-like interface to test Gemini models, including multimodal inputs such as uploading and analyzing video content, though reliability issues were observed during demonstration.\n",
    "- 🤔 The speaker expresses a personal preference for OpenAI models due to perceived better behavior and reliability, despite recent competitive changes in Gemini's pricing.\n",
    "- 🌐 The primary use case for Google's API for the speaker is integrating Google Search into applications rather than extensive use of the core Gemini models.\n",

    "\n",
    "# The Anthropic API for the Claude Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This video provides an overview of the Anthropic API (for Claude models), comparing its models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) and pricing directly with OpenAI and Gemini, concluding that Anthropic's offerings are currently less competitive in terms of cost and features despite having a large context window, leading to the decision not to use it for development in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "\n",
    "- 🤖 Introduces the Anthropic API, offering models named Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus, with Opus being the most capable but also the most expensive.\n",
    "- 💸 Provides a direct pricing comparison, stating that Claude Opus is significantly more expensive per token (15x input, 75x output per million tokens) than OpenAI's GPT-4 (3x input, 5x output cheaper), which is perceived as more powerful.\n",
    "- ⚖️ Compares Sonnet's price to the best GPT model and Haiku's price to GPT 3.5, finding them generally less competitive.\n",
    "- 📏 Mentions the large 200,000-token context window of Anthropic models but still deems them not competitive at this time.\n",
    "- 📚 Standard API practices like accessing documentation and creating API keys are noted as available.\n",
    "- 🤔 Concludes that currently, the Anthropic API is not competitive with Gemini (which offers features like Search API) and especially not with OpenAI (which has stronger models, Assistant API, DTS), leading to the decision not to use it for development for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary of the Closed-Source APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This video serves as a recap of the previously covered closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic), comparing their models, pricing, and features, strongly recommending the OpenAI API for application development due to its perceived superior models and competitive pricing, and introduces the next section which will focus on open-source models.\n",
    "\n",
