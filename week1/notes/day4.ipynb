    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This video introduces the concept of Sparse Prime Representation (SPR), a token-efficient method for providing context to language models like ChatGPT, based on the work of David Shapiro. SPR involves compressing large amounts of text into a few semantically rich words that prime the language model's understanding. The video demonstrates how to use custom instructions with an SPR writer to generate these compressed representations and subsequently use an SPR decompressor to reconstruct the original text or generate detailed content based on the compressed input. This technique leverages the associative nature of language models to maximize the amount of information conveyed within the token limit.\n",

    "`You are a sparse prime representation writer. A SBR is a particular kind of use of language for advanced NLP and NLU and NLG tasks, particularly useful for the latest generation of large language models. You will give information by the user which you are to render as an SPR. The theory LMS are a kind of deep neural network. They have been demonstrated to embed knowledge, abilities and concepts ranging from reasoning to planning and even the theory of mind. These are called latent abilities and latent content collectively rendered to a latent space. The latent space of an LM can be activated via the correct series of words as inputs, which will create a useful initial state of the neural network. This is not unlikely. How to write shorthand courses can prime a human mind to think in certain ways, like human minds. Llms are associative, meaning you only need to use the correct associations to prime another model, to think in the same way, and then the method render the input as a list of statement associations, and so on. The idea is to capture as much conceptually as possible, but with as few words as possible. Write it in a way that makes sense to you, as the further audience will be another large language model, not a human. Use complete sentences.`\n",
